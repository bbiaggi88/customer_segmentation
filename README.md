# Customer Segmentation

This project performs customer segmentation using clustering techniques. The goal is to group customers into distinct segments to better understand their behaviors and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Project Description

Customer segmentation is a crucial task in marketing to identify and target specific groups of customers. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic information. The main steps in this project include data preprocessing, feature engineering, clustering, and visualizing the clusters.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### 1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bbiaggi88/customer_segmentation.git
cd customer_segmentation
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```sh
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install the required packages
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the customer segmentation analysis, launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `customer_segmentation.ipynb` file.
```sh
jupyter notebook customer_segmentation.ipynb
```

In the notebook, you will find the complete workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, clustering, and visualization steps. Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
